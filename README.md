## Hi there, I'm Favian Teo.

I'm 21, and I live in Singapore! I'm not a very interesting person. But here's some stuff that I like:

**üé∏ MUSIC!** 

I play the classical/acoustic guitar, and a sprinkle of piano. Music's often my go-to when the day gets long and/or boring. A few of my favourite modern musicians are Lisa Hannigan, Gregory Alan Isakov and CHVRCHES, in that order :) And I'm a huge fan of the oldies: Chopin, Lizst and Augustin Barrios; to name a few.

**‚öôÔ∏è TECH!** 

When I'm not immersing myself in music, I'm adept with new technology, languages, (*~and 10 new JS frameworks~*) that spring up from time to time. Be it software or hardware, I'm always on the lookout for new breakthroughs in the ever-growing and adapting environment of technology.

**üéÆ GAMING!** 

At the end of the day, I might just wind down for a few hours of gaming. Well, not as much as I did a few years ago, but I am still very critical of well-constructed and enjoyable games. One of my absolute favourites is Far Cry 5; love its open-world design!

## My developer proficiency üìñ
I love to expose myself to the many quirks of different web technologies when I have time. Here's what I'm comfortable with so far:
